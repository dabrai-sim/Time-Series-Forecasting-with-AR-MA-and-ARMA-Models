# Time Series Forecasting with AR, MA, and ARMA Models

## Project Overview
This project involves modeling and forecasting average temperatures using Auto Regressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), and Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) models. It demonstrates how to check for stationarity, perform differencing, and select the best ARIMA model for forecasting.

## Features
- Load and preprocess time series data.
- Plot time series data to visualize trends and patterns.
- Perform the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity.
- Train ARIMA models and forecast future values.
- Evaluate the model performance using RMSE.

## Technical Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels
- Pmdarima
